Welcome to my NLP Essentials GitHub repository! This project is a deep dive into the heart of natural language processing, crafted with the curious mind of both beginners and intermediate NLP enthusiasts in mind. Through a series of Jupyter notebooks, we explore the fundamental steps of processing and analyzing textual data, paving the way for more advanced machine learning applications.

What's Inside?
Document Representation: Discover the art of transforming raw text into a structured format that machines can understand. This notebook delves into the creation of Bag-of-Words models, showcasing how documents can be represented as numerical vectors.

* Encoding Text for Machine Learning: Before we can train machine learning models, we need to speak their language. This notebook guides you through encoding textual information in a way that's digestible for algorithms, focusing on term frequency and document frequency concepts.

* Stop Words in NLP: Ever wondered how to filter out the noise in textual data? This notebook illuminates the concept of stop words, providing hands-on examples of how to identify and remove them to enhance data quality.

* Working with Real Data: Theory is good, but practice makes perfect. Here, we tackle real-world data, applying our NLP techniques to cleanse, process, and prepare datasets for analysis or machine learning projects.

* Advanced Stop Word Creation: Not all stop words come pre-packaged. Learn how to automatically identify and create stop word lists tailored to your specific data, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of your NLP models.

Dive Deeper
Each notebook is crafted with love, detailed comments, and practical examples to not just teach but engage you in the marvels of text processing. Whether you're looking to understand the basics of document representation, get your hands dirty with real data, or refine your machine learning models with sophisticated text encoding techniques, this repository is your go-to guide.

Join me on this adventure through the landscape of natural language processing. Together, we'll unlock the secrets of text, one word at a time.
